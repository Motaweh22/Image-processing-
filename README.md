# Image Processing Utilities

This repository contains a collection of Python utilities for image processing. The utilities are designed to perform various operations on images, such as grayscale conversion, halftoning, histogram equalization, edge detection, filtering, and more. The code is built using popular libraries like `Pillow`, `NumPy`, `OpenCV`, and `Matplotlib`.

## Usage

### Metadata Extraction

Extract metadata from an image, including dimensions, color mode, and EXIF data.

```python
from image_utils import get_metadata

```python
from image_utils import get_histograms

with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

histogram = get_histograms(image_bytes)
```

```python
from image_utils import apply_filtering
from operations import FilteringOperation

with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

operation = FilteringOperation(mode='low', kernel_size=5, sigma=1.0)
filtered_image = apply_filtering(image_bytes, operation)
```

### Image Operations

Perform basic image operations like rotation, flipping, resizing, and inversion.

```python
from image_utils import apply_single_image_operation
from operations import SingleImageOperation

with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

# Rotate the image by 45 degrees
operation = SingleImageOperation(operation='rotate', angle=45)
rotated_image = apply_single_image_operation(image_bytes, operation)
```

### Multi-Image Operations

Combine multiple images using operations like addition, subtraction, and cut-paste.

```python
from image_utils import apply_multi_image_operation
from operations import MultiImageOperation

with open('image1.jpg', 'rb') as f1, open('image2.jpg', 'rb') as f2:
    image_bytes_list = [f1.read(), f2.read()]

# Add two images
operation = MultiImageOperation(operation='add')
combined_image = apply_multi_image_operation(image_bytes_list, operation)
```

### Histogram Segmentation

Segment images based on histogram analysis.

```python
from image_utils import apply_histogram_segmentation
from operations import HistogramSegmentationOperation

with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

operation = HistogramSegmentationOperation(mode='peak', value=128, segment=True)
segmented_image = apply_histogram_segmentation(image_bytes, operation)
```
